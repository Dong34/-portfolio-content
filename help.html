					Help
				</div>
				<p>"Help!" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that served as the title song for the 1965 film 
                    and its soundtrack album. It was released as a single in July 1965, and was number one for three weeks 
                    in the United States and the United Kingdom.
				</p>

                <p>Credited to Lennon-McCartney, "Help!" was written by John Lennon with some help from Paul McCartney. 
                    In the 1970 Rolling Stone "Lennon Remembers" interviews, Lennon said that the song was one of his 
                    favourites among the Beatles songs he wrote. According to Lennon's cousin and boyhood friend Stanley Parkes,
                    "Help!" was written after Lennon "came in from the studio one night. 'God,' he said, 
                    'they've changed the title of the film: it's going to be called 'Help!' now. So I've had to write a new song 
                    with the title called 'Help!'."
